INPUTS:
InputA is the input of 16 bits representing an unsigned integer that is used to bring data bits to the Adder, Subtractor, Divider, Modulus and the multiplier.
InputB is the input of 16 bits representing an unsigned integer that is used to bring data bits to the Adder, Subtractor, Divider, Modulus and the multiplier.
OPCode is the input of 4 bits that represents a unique code to signify which calculation will be used as the result. All 4 bits feed into the decoder. Also,
the least significant bit feeds into the Adder-Subtractor as the mode.


OUTPUTS:
Result is a 32 bit output representing the result of the chosen arithmetic calculation.
Error is a two bit output where the most significant bit represents the error from the Divider or the Modulus modules and the least significant bit represents
the error from the Adder-Subtractor.


INTERFACES:
ADD Interface is a 32 bit wire that connects from the Adder-Subtractor result to the MULTIPLEXOR channel 0.
SUBT Interface is a 32 bit wire that connects from the Adder-Subtractor result to the MULTIPLEXOR channel 1.
MULT Interface is a 32 bit wire that connects from the Multiplier result to the MULTIPLEXOR channel 2.
DIV Interface is a 32 bit wire that connects from the Divider result to the MULTIPLEXOR channel 3.
MOD Interface is a 32 bit wire that connects from the Modulus result to the MULTIPLEXOR channel 4.

DIV_ERR Interface is a 1 bit wire that connects the Divider error output to the OR GATE 
MOD_ERR Interface is a 1 bit wire that connects the Modulus error output to the OR GATE 

DEC_to_MUX is a 16 bit one hot wire that connects from the Decoder to the Multiplexor select.
Mode is a 1 bit register that holds the value of the first bit of OPCode and feeds into the Adder-Subtractor mode input.



COMBINATIONAL LOGIC COMPONENTS: 

HALFADDER has inputs of A and B which is a combinational circuit and the role of this circuit is to produce subtraction of two bits invidiual bits. The result will be 32 bits.

FullAdder has Inputs A, B are to be added and Cin which is the previous carry bit. Also the FullAdder is a combinational circuit that does airithmetic by using two HalfAdders. 
There are 3 bits that are used to produce a result of two outputs. Which as the Sum and the Co is the carry bit that is generated by the current sum.  The result will be 32 bits.


AdderSubtractor The module that handles Addition and Subtraction of bits from input A and InputB also the outputs for this combinationa logic components is the carry and the sum. The 
input [15:0]inputA;, input [15:0]inputB; are both 16 bits and the result will be just a combination of 32 bits. 

MMULTIPLEXOR of 16bits inputs going to a 32bit output with a result to reach a final Output of a DISPLAY such as a screen.
