INPUTS:
InputA is the input of 16 bits representing an unsigned integer that is used to bring data bits to the Adder, Subtractor, Divider, Modulus and the multiplier.
InputB is the input of 16 bits representing an unsigned integer that is used to bring data bits to the Adder, Subtractor, Divider, Modulus and the multiplier.
OPCode is the input of 4 bits that represents a unique code to signify which calculation will be used as the result. All 4 bits feed into the decoder. Also,
the least significant bit feeds into the Adder-Subtractor as the mode.


OUTPUTS:
Result is a 32 bit output representing the result of the chosen arithmetic calculation.
Error is a two bit output where the most significant bit represents the error from the Divider or the Modulus modules and the least significant bit represents
the error from the Adder-Subtractor.


INTERFACES:
ADD Interface is a 32 bit wire that connects from the Adder-Subtractor result to the MULTIPLEXOR
SUBT Interface is a 32 bit wire that connects from the Adder-Subtractor result to the MULTIPLEXOR
MULT Interface is a 32 bit wire that connects from the Multiplier result to the MULTIPLEXOR
DIV Interface is a 32 bit wire that connects from the Divider result to the MULTIPLEXOR

DIV_ERR Interface is a 1 bit wire that connects the Divider error output to the OR GATE 
MOD_ERR Interface is a 1 bit wire that connects the Modulus error output to the OR GATE 

ORtoMUX_Interface connects the OR GATE to the MULTIPLEXOR



WIRE errMOD known as the Error Mod bit that is used for the modulo thats in the modulus module.
Wire errDIV A error bit that is used in the Divisor for the divison module
wire oneHOTmux this is a value that is of the corresponding input(s) and thus the selectors with thei nputs are then bascially added together however I want to say concatinated.
wire channels this is the interface that allows the total of two sets of 16 bits to intermingle to become 32 bits for the multiplexor specifically.
The RegMode determine which happens either the Adder or the subtractor tobe used on the Two inputs of A and B to be used to result in 32 bits. 




COMBINATIONAL LOGIC COMPONENTS: 

HALFADDER has inputs of A and B which is a combinational circuit and the role of this circuit is to produce subtraction of two bits invidiual bits. The result will be 32 bits.

FullAdder has Inputs A, B are to be added and Cin which is the previous carry bit. Also the FullAdder is a combinational circuit that does airithmetic by using two HalfAdders. 
There are 3 bits that are used to produce a result of two outputs. Which as the Sum and the Co is the carry bit that is generated by the current sum.  The result will be 32 bits.


AdderSubtractor The module that handles Addition and Subtraction of bits from input A and InputB also the outputs for this combinationa logic components is the carry and the sum. The 
input [15:0]inputA;, input [15:0]inputB; are both 16 bits and the result will be just a combination of 32 bits. 

MMULTIPLEXOR of 16bits inputs going to a 32bit output with a result to reach a final Output of a DISPLAY such as a screen.
